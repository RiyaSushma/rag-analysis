I remember thinking then how good the story was and how helpful \nit would be to me from that moment on.  \n \nWho Moved My Cheese?  is a story about change that takes place in a Maze where four \namusing characters look for “Cheese”-cheese being a metaphor for what we want to \nhave in life, whether it is  a job, a relationship, money, a big house, freedom, health,", "amusing characters look for “Cheese”-cheese being a metaphor for what we want to \nhave in life, whether it is  a job, a relationship, money, a big house, freedom, health, \nrecognition, spiritual peace, or even  an activity like jogging or golf.  \n \nEach of us has our own idea of what Cheese is, and we pursue it because we believe it \nmakes us happy. If we get it, we often become a ttached to it. And if we lose it, or it's \ntaken away, it can be traumatic.  \n \nThe “Maze” in the story represents wher e you spend time looking for what you want. \nIt can be the organization you work in, the community you live in, or the relationships \nyou have in your life.  \n \nI tell the Cheese story that you are about to read in my talks around the world, and often hear later from people about what a difference it has made to them.  \n \nBelieve it or not, this little story has been  credited with saving careers, marriages and \nlives!", "Believe it or not, this little story has been  credited with saving careers, marriages and \nlives! \n \nOne of the many real-life examples come s from Charlie Jones, a well-respected \nbroadcaster for NBC- TV, who revealed th at hearing the story of “Who Moved My \nCheese?” saved his career.

They keep \nmoving our “cheese.” While in the past we may have wanted loyal employees, today \nwe need flexible people who are not po ssessive about “the way things are done \naround here.”  \n \nAnd yet, as you know, living in constant wh ite water with the changes occurring all \nthe time at work or in life can be stre ssful, unless people have a way of looking at \nchange that helps them unders tand it.

They wanted to hear more about what was happening in each other’s lives. After a good  deal of kidding, and a good meal, they \nsettled into an interesting conversation.  \n \nAngela, who had been one of the most popular people in the class, said, “Life sure turned out differently than I thought it would when we were in school. A lot has changed.” \n \n“It certainly has,” Nathan echoed. They knew he had gone into his family’s business, which had operated pretty much the same and had been a part of the local community for \nas long as they could remember. So, they were surprised when he seemed concerned. He \nasked, “But, have you noticed how we don’t want to change when things change?” \n \nCarlos said, “I guess we resist changing because we’re afraid of change.” \n \n“Carlos, you were Captain of the football team,” Jessica said. “I never thought I’d hear you say anything about being afraid!”', '“Carlos, you were Captain of the football team,” Jessica said. “I never thought I’d hear you say anything about being afraid!” \n \nThey all laughed as they realized that although they had gone off in different directions – from working at home to managing companies – they were experiencing similar feelings. \n \nEveryone was trying to cope with the unexpected changes that were happening to them in recent years. And most admitted that they did not know a good way to handle them. \n \nThen Michael said, “I used to be afraid of change. When a big chance came along in our \nbusiness, we didn’t know what to do. So we didn’t do anything differently and we almost \nlost it.” \n \n“That is,” he continued, “until I heard a funny little story that changed everything.” \n \n“How so?” Nathan asked \n \n“Well, the story altered the way I looked at change, and after that, things quickly \nimproved for me – at work and in my life.”', '“How so?” Nathan asked \n \n“Well, the story altered the way I looked at change, and after that, things quickly \nimproved for me – at work and in my life.” \n \n“Then, I passed the story on to some people in our company and they passed it on to \nothers, and soon our business did much better, because we all adapted to change better. And like me, many people said helped them in their personal lives.” \n \n“What’s the story?” Angela asked. \n \n“It’s called, ‘Who Moved My Cheese?” \n \nThe grouped laughed. “I think I like it already,” Carlos said, “Would you tell us the story?” \n \n“Sure,” Michael replied. “I’d be happy to – it doesn’t take long.” And so he began: The Story \n \nOnce, long ago in a land far aw ay, there lived four little characters who ran through a \nmaze looking for cheese to nourish then and make them happy. \n \nTwo were mice named “Sniff” and “Scurry” a nd two were littlepe ople – beings who \nwere as small as mice but who looked and acted a lot like people today.

But if you looked closely enough, you c ould discover the most amazing things! \n \nEvery day the mice and the littlepeople spen t time in the maze looking for their own \nspecial cheese. \n \nThe mice, Sniff and Scurry, possessing only si mple rodent brains, but good instincts, \nsearched for the hard nibbling cheese they liked, as mice often do. \n \nThe two people, Hem and Haw, used their brains, filled with many beliefs, to search for a very different kind of Cheese – with  a capital C – which they believed would \nmake them feel happy and successful.  \n \nAs different as the mice and littlepeople we re, they shared something in common:', 'make them feel happy and successful.  \n \nAs different as the mice and littlepeople we re, they shared something in common: \nevery morning, they each put on their jogging suits and runni ng shoes, left their little \nhomes, and race out into the maze looking for their favorite cheese. \n \nThe maze was a labyrinth of corridors an d chambers, some containing delicious \ncheese. But there were also dark corners a nd blind alleys leading nowhere. It was easy \nplace for anyone to get lost. \n \nHowever, the two littlepeople, Hem and Haw,  used a different method that relied on \ntheir ability to think and learn from th eir past experiences, although, they would \nsometimes get confused by their beliefs and emotions. \n \nEventually in their own way, they all discovered what they  were looking for – they \neach found their own kind of cheese one day at the end of one of the corridors in \nCheese Station C. \n \nEvery morning after that, the mice and the littlepeople dressed in their running gear', 'each found their own kind of cheese one day at the end of one of the corridors in \nCheese Station C. \n \nEvery morning after that, the mice and the littlepeople dressed in their running gear \nand headed over to Cheese Station C.

Then they enjoyed the cheese. \n In the beg inning Hem  and Haw also  raced  toward Cheese Station C every m orning to \nenjoy the tas ty new m orsels th at awaited them . \n \nBut after a while, a different rout ine set in f or the littlepeople. \n \nHem  and Haw awoke each day a little later, d ressed a little slower, an d walked to', 'But after a while, a different rout ine set in f or the littlepeople. \n \nHem  and Haw awoke each day a little later, d ressed a little slower, an d walked to \nCheese Station C.

Soon they became so \ncomfortable they didn’t even notice what was happening. \n \nAs time went on, Sniff and Scurry continued their routine.

And they were not burdened with many \ncomplex beliefs. \n \nTo the mice, the problem and the answer were both simple. The situation at Cheese \nStation C had changed. So, Sniff an d Scurry decided to change.  \n \nThey both looked out into the maze.

They had not been \npaying attention to the small changes that  had been taking place each day, so they \ntook it for granted their Cheese would be there. \n \nThey were unprepared for what they found. \n “What! No Cheese?” Hem yelled. He continued yelling, “No Cheese? No Cheese?” as \nthough if he shouted loud enough someone would put back. \n \n“Who moved my Cheese?” he hollered. \n \nFinally, he put his hands on his hips, his face turned red, and he screamed at the top of \nhis voice, “It’s not fair!” \n \nHaw just shook his head in disbelief.

They had their own ideas of what Cheese meant to them, depending on \ntheir taste. \n \nFor some, finding Cheese was having material  things.

He hadn't had any Chees e for so long that he was now weak. It \ntook him longer and it was more painful than usual to get through the maze. He \ndecided that if he ever got the chance again, he would ad apt to change sooner.
